# nexus3D - Additive Manufacturing & Modelling

## Business Overview
Professional 3D printing and modelling service for industrial clients. Provides precision manufacturing from prototyping to production with documented quality control.

## Required Machines
- **FDM** (Fused Deposition Modeling) - ✅ **OWNED: Anycubic Kobra S1**
- **DLP** (Digital Light Processing) - ⚠️ NEEDED
- **SLS** (Selective Laser Sintering) - ⚠️ NEEDED
- **MJF** (Multi Jet Fusion) - ⚠️ NEEDED
- **PolyJet** (Multi-material printing) - ⚠️ NEEDED
- **3D Scanner** (For replication service) - ⚠️ NEEDED

### ❌ NOT Needed:
- **Laser Cutter** - Not required for 3D printing services (different process - subtractive vs additive)
- **CNC Mill** - Not needed unless expanding to hybrid manufacturing

## Materials Status
### ✅ Currently Have:
- **PLA** - Black, White, Gray, Orange (4 colors)

### ⚠️ Still Need:
- **More PLA colors** (For multi-color jobs)
- **TPU** (Flexible material)
- **PA12/Nylon** (For functional parts)
- **Resin** (For DLP printing)

## Services Offered
### ✅ Can Start NOW (with Kobra S1):
1. **Rapid Prototyping** - Basic PLA prototypes
2. **Product Mockup** - Visual models in 4 colors
3. **3D Modelling** - CAD design services
4. **Small Batch** - Limited runs in PLA

### ⚠️ Need Equipment For:
5. **Large-Scale** - Up to 2.2m builds (need bigger printer)
6. **Multi-Colour** - CMYK printing (need PolyJet)
7. **Functional Parts** - Batch Production (need SLS/MJF)
8. **Positive for Mould** - Master patterns (need resin printer)
9. **Replication** - Scan to print (need 3D scanner)

## Business Assessment
**Current Capability:** ~30% of services (basic prototyping only)  
**Revenue Potential:** Low - Limited to PLA mockups and design  
**Investment Priority:** 3D Scanner ($500-2K) → DLP Resin Printer ($2-5K) → Industrial SLS/MJF ($20K+)  
**Start Strategy:** Focus on design services + basic prototypes while building capital for equipment
